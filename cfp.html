      <h1>SysTEX '22</h1>
      <p>5th Workshop on System Software for Trusted Execution (SysTEX 2022)</p> 
      <p><b>February 28th, 2022</b></p> 
    </div>

    <div class="mt-4 p-5">
      <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
      <p>
      With the rise of new hardware extensions that permit fine-grained and flexible trusted execution, we need appropriate systems support that makes trusted execution environments (TEEs) such as Intel's SGX and TDX, AMDâ€™s SEV-SNP, or ARM's TrustZone conveniently usable by application developers. The 5th Workshop on System Software for Trusted Execution (SysTEX) will focus on systems research challenges related to TEEs, and explore new ideas and strategies for the implementation of trustworthy systems with TEEs.
      </p>
      <p>
      Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Architecture, applications and implementation technologies for trusted platforms and trustworthy infrastructures</li>
        <li>Middleware for distributed trusted execution</li>
        <li>OS support for trusted execution</li>
        <li>Trustworthy infrastructures and services for cloud computing (including resilience)</li>
        <li>Attestation and integrity verification</li>
        <li>Cryptographic aspects of trusted and trustworthy computing</li>
        <li>Intrusion resilience in trusted computing</li>

        <li>Security policy and management of trusted computing</li>
        <li>Privacy aspects of trusted computing</li>
        <li>Verification of trusted computing architectures</li>
        <li>Usability and end-user interactions with trusted platforms</li>
        <li>Limitations of trusted computing</li>
        <li>Usability and user perceptions of trustworthy systems and risks</li>
        <li>Use case studies of trusted execution</li>
        <li>Validation and performance evaluation of trusted hardware</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        Workshop Format
      </h3>
      <p>
      The goal of the workshop is to foster collaboration and discussion among researchers and practitioners in this field. The workshop will be one full day. The program should include a mix of academic and industrial presentations and invited talks, ending with a panel discussion.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Important dates (Times are AOE)

      <h3>
        Submission Guidelines
      </h3>
      <p>
      SysTEX welcomes submissions in two formats:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Regular research papers of at most 6 pages</strong> excluding references. Research papers should be either early stage work looking for feedback from the community or small contributions that don't require a full paper to describe and should not be previously published.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Short research statements of at most 1-2 pages</strong>. Research statements aim at fostering discussion and collaboration. Research statements may summarize research published elsewhere or outline new emerging ideas.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      All submissions should be in PDF and must follow the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template"</a>ACM SIGPLAN format</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Reviewing is single-blind, and the names and affiliations of the authors must appear in the submitted papers. Each paper will receive at least three reviews from members of the program committee.
      </p>
